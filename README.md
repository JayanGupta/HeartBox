# HeartBox: ML-Integrated Portable ECG Machine

## Overview
HeartBox is an innovative project aimed at developing a portable ECG machine integrated with machine learning algorithms to classify heart health. The device provides real-time diagnostics, categorizing heart health into various classifications, thus aiding in the early detection and management of cardiac conditions.

## Project Structure
- `hardware/`: Design and schematics of the portable ECG machine.
- `data/`: Contains the dataset(s) used for training and testing the ML models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks documenting the model development and evaluation process.
## Features
- **Portable ECG Machine**: Compact, easy-to-use device for capturing ECG signals.
- **Real-time Classification**: On-device machine learning models for immediate heart health assessment.
- **Multiple Classifications**: Capable of categorizing heart health into various conditions such as normal, arrhythmia, tachycardia, and more.

## Results
The HeartBox project achieves accurate heart health classification with key metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score available in the `results/` directory. Visualizations include confusion matrices and ROC curves to demonstrate model performance.
